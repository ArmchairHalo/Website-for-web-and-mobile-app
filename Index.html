        <h2>What is the objective of the game?</h2>
        <p>The objective is to run around the level and grab enough animals to open the exit gates all while avoiding the enemies in the level which get progressively harder to defeat as the more levels you pass.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>What can you do in the game?</h2>
        <p>In the game you will be able to run around the level freely trying to find the missing animals, jump to reach high platforms or to get rid of enemies and you will be able to jump off walls in order to gain some extra height or chain wall jumps to reach areas not normally possible to reach with a regular jump.</p>
